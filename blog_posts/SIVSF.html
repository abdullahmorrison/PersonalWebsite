        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I have recently discovered things about myself that resulted in me to creating a framework for pursuing my goals and achieving them. It also allows me to create goals and know whether or not these goals are possible to accomplish.
        </p>
        <h3>How I came up with this framework</h3>
        <p>
            I created this framework from listening to Ali and Taimur Abdaal's podcast "Not Overthinking."

            Ali was the one talking about the a book review the Elephant in the brain and how people always have a "good" reason for doing things and a "selfish" reason. 

            Ali constantly brought up the idea that everyone should start a blog in his podcast.

            Taimur and Ali once brought up something on prestige and how most people do things solely to achieve prestige

            looking at my greatest achievement yet also helped me create the framework. That achievement being the type of person that can easily go to the gym, workout, and achieve their dream physique.

            When looking back at that accomplishment, I thought to myself, "why is it so easy for me to go to the gym everyday and work hard, but for most other people, it is the hardest things in the world." I realized that it had to do with 2 reasons, one is the short term validation I get from doing the thing and the second is the long term trajectory I have.
        </p>
        <h3>Examples of this framework working in my life</h3>
        <p>
            When I realized this, I tested the theory with all the other things I have managed to do that benefit me:
            - Journaling: I started journaling on June 25, 2019 and I still journal to this day.
                ○ Validation
                    § I get validation from writing as if I am writing to a future self or an audience that cares about my story. My audience and or myself will be able to look at my life incredibly close. When I'm old, will have sooooo much written about myself and the thing that are going on in my life. Anything that I felt that was worth telling is written in my journal. I will get a huge wave of nostalgia when looking back at this. Also, with any major struggle that I have, once I escape that struggle, I will be able to look back on the things I went through with pride knowing that I overcame them. This stuff is validating in the short-term because I can already imagine being old and looking back on it. That is instantly gratifying.
                ○ The self-improvement 
                    § Improving self-awareness
                    § Releasing my emotions by writing them
                    § Giving myself the ability to evaluate my beliefs since it is being written
            - Working out: I started working out when my mom first asked if I wanted a gym membership at Movati in the Summer of grade 11. in highschool I would workout everyday during the summers. I started getting serious during first year university where I workout single day. I love working out so much that I get very upset and my day get messed up if I cannot workout. So, covid-19 really messed with me.
                ○ Validation
                    § When I was first starting to workout
                        □ I used to wake up at 5:30 and take a bus for 30min just to go to the gym. That was validation because I felt a sense of prestige from waking up before the sun rises and working hard
                        □ The workouts themselves were not validating, but because it was validating to go to the gym, I would put all that effort in getting there which made me want to maximize my time and be useful
                    § Now that I have a lot of knowledge in working out:
                        □ I get validation from lifting heavy weights
                        □ I get validation from hitting new PRs
                            ® My knowledge in myself and my workouts allow me to know that progress is being made every workout in tangible ways. I'm pretty consistently hitting new PRs
                ○ Self-improvement
                    § I'm building muscle
                    § I'm improving my mental health
                    § Building strength
            - Blogging: The reason I'm starting this blog
                ○ Validation
                    § The prestige of creating content and someone might find valuable
                    § Thinking of someone looking at my content and gaining knowledge from it, and ultimately appreciating me for it
                    § Thinking that friends or girls that are interested in me might choose to stalk me and find that I am working on things that are kinda cool
                ○ Self-improvement
                    § It will allow me to develop the ideas I have so that it is fully fleshed out.
                        □ All these ideas are just things that stay in my head. Blogging it will force me to develop it more
                    § It will benefit my resume to improve work opportunities
                    § It will make me program the blog websites which will improve my programming skills
                    § Gives me new ideas of different things I want to write about and do
                        □ 2020-12-03 8:15 AM: I just thought about creating a section on my website talking about all the people that played a huge role in my life
            - Programming:
                ○ Validation:
                    § There is prestige in accomplishing programming projects. Because you are accomplishing your goals that can be shown to others (like a trophy)
                    § Every time I complete a little feature for my program I feel rewarded
                ○ Self-improvement
                    § Better job opportunities
                    § Give opportunities to create new things
            - Waking up early (5:30am)
                ○ Validation
                    § There is prestige in waking up early. Because you are awake before anyone else and immediately doing hard work
                ○ Self-improvement
                    § Forces a good sleep schedule
                    § Encourages discipline
            Starts the day off well, with an accomplishment
        </p>
        <h3>Example of failures that do not apply the framework</h3>
        <p>
            Things that I've done only for validation
            - Running (when the gyms closed. I didn't want to workout because it felt pointless since I would lose strength no matter what)
                ○ I ended up quitting because if felt pointless. There was no future goal for it. It was only temporary until the gyms reopened

            Things I'm trying to do, but it is only for self-improvement (I can't find a good way to make it validating
                - Meditation
                    ○ When I started, I had some validation because there is prestige in doing these things. But that caused me to not focus on the meditation and more on accomplishing it.
                    ○ When I focus more on the meditation, it ultimately failed because I really don't sit in silence and focus on being present. It takes so much effort
                - Reading
                    ○ I'm a REALLY slow reader. I would get validation from completing normal sized chapters (around 15 pages), but I read so slow that I lose interest before I can finish the chapter. So, I have to stop before chapter 

            Future Plans for this framework
                - Tiktok YouTube Channel: The YouTube videos that post tiktoks post the most cringe tiktoks which is why xqc thinks tiktok is cringe. I want to look back at my liked videos but I don't want to put that effort. They are so much better. Posting them on YouTube will. I will learn to edit.
                - Guitar/ music creation: I want to learn guitar. I would love to make music and have it blow up.
        </p>
        <h3>Possible issues with the framework</h3>
        <p>
            Once I achieve the goal I may not want to continue. I'm not sure though.

            With every system, the reasons certain things benefit you can also be the reason the damage you. One way this system hurts me is when I do not get the things that I am expected to accomplish/have. 

            Society expects you to complete schooling, get a good paying job, get into a good relationship, get married, have a healthy social life, etc. I also accept these expectations on myself. So, if there a scenario where I feel society expects me to have reached these milestones that I believe are worth having accomplished (for example: getting married in the window of your mid 20s to your late 30s) and I have not done so, I will feel extremely bad about myself.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            This thing is really like a back door/trick to achieving your goals. Like if you want to achieve a goal but don't want to do the thing, do a thing that you want to do, that also achieves your goal as a by product

            This is a framework that I created long before I was aware that it existed. It can be used by many other people. But I'm not sure if it can apply to everyone. If you decide to try accomplishing goals with this framework and you fail, it is possible that you are either applying the framework incorrectly or it is simply not meant for you. If it's not meant for you then it is important that figure out the frameworks that you create in your own life so that you can use it in the best way possible and minimize any possible downsides to it.
