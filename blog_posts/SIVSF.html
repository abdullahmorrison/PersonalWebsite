        <h4>Start of writing November 28, 2020</h4>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I have recently discovered things about myself that resulted in me to creating a framework for pursuing my goals and achieving them. This framework allowed me to create goals and know whether or not these goals are possible to accomplish.
        </p>
         <p>
            The framework works with the two main desires for creating goals. Those being, seeking self-improvement and seeking validation. In order for a goal to succeed, one must be fulfilling both these desires. The reason we need the goal we create to seek self-improvement is so that it gives us a long-term goal. That long-term goal gives a trajectory that allows us to know whether the steps were are taking are leading us to the things we want. We need the goal we create to seek validation because we need a constant positive feedback loop that causes us to want to continuously do the work that is necessary to achieve our goals. Validation strikes dopamine in the brain and that causes us to want to work more and more harder to keep receiving that dopamine.
         </p>  
         <p>
            This framework can be explained best through a driving analogy. Seeking self-improvement would be like having a destination. The more you understand the route you need to take, the more you will know whether you have taken a wrong turn. Seeking validation would be the type of vehicle you have to get you to that destination. The better the vehicle, the faster you can go to get to the destination.
         </p> 
        <h3>How I came up with this framework</h3>
        <p>
            I created this framework through learning about myself, listening to Ali and Taimur Abdaal's podcast "Not Overthinking," and watching Ali Abdaal's YouTube videos. In on of Ali's YouTube videos, he did a book review on a book called, "The Elephant in the Brain." It talks about how people always have a "good" reason for doing things and a "selfish" reason. For example, a "good" reason to create a blog would be to help others by teaching them things that you've discovered about yourself, and the "selfish" reason would be to increase your social status by signaling your intelligence and self-awareness to others. The "good "reason made me create the self-improvement seeking side and the "selfish" reason made me create the validation seeking side.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then looked back at a major accomplishment that many people find extremely difficult to achieve. That accomplishment was becoming the type of person the goes to the gym consistently (I go every day), loves it, and has gained a physique that most people would dream of having. I thought to myself, "why is it so easy for me to go to the gym everyday and work hard, but for most other people, it is the hardest things in the world." I realized that it had to do with my framework (explained more in next section). 
        </p>
        <p>
            That was when I realized that this framework it legitimate. So, I decided to apply it to as many things as I could in order to reach my goals and create new and achievable ones
        </p>
        <h3>Examples of this framework working in my life</h3>
        <p>
            <span>Working Out: </span>I started working out when my mom first asked if I wanted a gym membership at Movati Athletic in the Summer of 2017 (grade 11). In high school I would workout everyday during the summer time. I started getting serious during first year university where I would workout every single day all year round. I have developed a love for working out so strong that I get upset if I cannot workout. It also results in the rest of my day getting messed up . So, covid-19 lock downs are really messing me up.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <span>Validation: </span>When I was first starting to workout I knew nothing about how to have a proper workout. So, most of the time, I did very mediocre workouts and I would not push myself very hard because I did not know the best way to do that. I got zero validation from the workouts themselves. However, I used to wake up at 5:30am and take a bus for 30 minutes just to go to the gym and that was very validating because I felt a sense of prestige from waking up before the sun rises and working hard on myself. So, since I put all that effort in getting to the gym, it made me want to maximize my time and try my best to have a good workout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of writing this, (December 29, 2020) I am an intermediate lifter. So, now that I have a lot of knowledge in working out, I get validation from making progress in my the amount of weight I can lift for every exercise. My knowledge in lifting is high to point where I can predictably make progress in at least one exercise during almost every workout. And, when there is a day that I do not make progress in any lift or I reach the point where I am an advanced lifter, I also get validation from the prestige of lifting heavy weight and working on my physical health. The heavier the weight I can lift the more prestigious I feel.
