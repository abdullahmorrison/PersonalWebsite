        <h1 class="blog_post_title">The Self-Improvement & Validation Seeking Framework</h1>
        <h4>Start of writing November 28, 2020</h4>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I have recently discovered things about myself that resulted in me to creating a framework for pursuing my goals and achieving them. This framework allowed me to create goals and know whether or not these goals are possible to accomplish.
        </p>
         <p>
            The framework works with the two main desires for creating goals. Those being, seeking self-improvement and seeking validation. In order for a goal to succeed, one must be fulfilling both these desires. The reason we need the goal we create to seek self-improvement is so that it gives us a long-term goal. That long-term goal gives a trajectory that allows us to know whether the steps were are taking are leading us to the things we want. We need the goal we create to seek validation because we need a constant positive feedback loop that causes us to want to continuously do the work that is necessary to achieve our goals. Validation strikes dopamine in the brain and that causes us to want to work more and more harder to keep receiving that dopamine.
         </p>  
         <p>
            This framework can be explained best through a driving analogy. Seeking self-improvement would be like having a destination. The more you understand the route you need to take, the more you will know whether you have taken a wrong turn. Seeking validation would be the type of vehicle you have to get you to that destination. The better the vehicle, the faster you can go to get to the destination.
         </p> 
        <h3>How I came up with this framework</h3>
        <p>
            I created this framework through learning about myself, listening to <a href="https://notoverthinking.com/" target="_blank">Ali and Taimur Abdaal's podcast "Not Overthinking," </a> and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64" target="_blank">Ali Abdaal's YouTube videos</a>. In on of Ali's YouTube videos, he did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sothj2aipE" target="_blank">a book review on a book called, "The Elephant in the Brain."</a>  It talks about how people always have a "good" reason for doing things and a "selfish" reason. For example, a "good" reason to create a blog would be to help others by teaching them things that you've discovered about yourself, and the "selfish" reason would be to increase your social status by signaling your intelligence and self-awareness to others. The "good "reason made me create the self-improvement seeking side and the "selfish" reason made me create the validation seeking side.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then looked back at a major accomplishment that many people find extremely difficult to achieve. That accomplishment was becoming the type of person the goes to the gym consistently (I go every day), loves it, and has gained a physique that most people would dream of having. I thought to myself, "why is it so easy for me to go to the gym everyday and work hard, but for most other people, it is the hardest things in the world." I realized that it had to do with my framework (explained more in next section). 
        </p>
        <p>
            That was when I realized that this framework it legitimate. So, I decided to apply it to as many things as I could in order to reach my goals and create new and achievable ones
        </p>
        <h3>Examples of this framework working in my life</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Working Out: </b>I started working out when my mom first asked if I wanted a gym membership at Movati Athletic in the Summer of 2017 (grade 11). In high school I would workout everyday during the summer time. I started getting serious during first year university where I would workout every single day all year round. I have developed a love for working out so strong that I get upset if I cannot workout. It also results in the rest of my day getting messed up . So, covid-19 lock downs are really messing me up.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Validation: </b>When I was first starting to workout I knew nothing about how to have a proper workout. So, most of the time, I did very mediocre workouts and I would not push myself very hard because I did not know the best way to do that. I got zero validation from the workouts themselves. However, I used to wake up at 5:30am and take a bus for 30 minutes just to go to the gym and that was very validating because I felt a sense of prestige from waking up before the sun rises and working hard on myself. So, since I put all that effort in getting to the gym, it made me want to maximize my time and try my best to have a good workout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of writing this, (December 29, 2020) I am an intermediate lifter. So, now that I have a lot of knowledge in working out, I get validation from making progress in my the amount of weight I can lift for every exercise. My knowledge in lifting is high to point where I can predictably make progress in at least one exercise during almost every workout. And, when there is a day that I do not make progress in any lift or I reach the point where I am an advanced lifter, I also get validation from the prestige of lifting heavy weight and working on my physical health. The heavier the weight I can lift the more prestigious I feel.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Self-Improvement: </b>I'm building muscle, improving my mental health, and building strength.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Blogging: </b>Ali constantly brought up the idea that everyone should start a blog in his podcast, and I agreed. I want an online presence because Ali spoke about all the benefits that being well known can bring, but I did not want jump too deep into it too early. I want to start small, so I have decided to start a blog in my personal website.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Validation: </b>Putting educational content online signals my intellect and self-awareness. So, because of the possibility that others may see this content and think highly of me is validating, regardless if anyone actually sees it or not.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Self-improvement: </b>Blogging any important discoveries I find about myself and the world will allow me to develop the ideas I have so that they are fully fleshed out. If the idea stays in my head, it would make it harder to find any holes in my understanding. It will also cause me to think about these idea more and may result in new frameworks being created.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will give me more incentive to program the blog websites and write the blog posts which will improve my programming and writing skills. It will also benefit my resume to improve work opportunities by showing employers the side projects I work on.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Programming: </b>My ultimate career goal is to create something that I and others can be proud of. Programming is a tool that allows for the possibility for almost anything to be built with it. That is the reason I chose to take computer science as my university program.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Validation: </b>There is prestige programming because people that code are considered pretty smart. So, making progress on programming projects signals to myself and others that I have good intellect. As a result, every time I complete a little feature for a program I am working on, I feel rewarded.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Self-improvement: </b>Working on many programming projects improves my skills in it and allows me to create bigger and better things. This also allows for better job opportunities.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Journaling: </b>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVzGGJHIJiE" target="_blank">a video by Matt D'Avella</a> where he spoke about the many benefits that journaling can bring. So, I started journaling on June 25, 2019 and I have managed to continue journaling to this day.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Validation: </b>I journal as if I am writing to a future self or an audience that cares about my story. From this perspective, I am able to create distance between the things that I am going through and myself. This allows me to view my experiences from an objective lens and not get caught up in the emotions which allows me to better solve the issues I have. This is validating because I get instant feedback that journaling is working. It became therapeutic because journaling sometimes becomes a brain dump of all my emotions, and that ultimately signals to myself and others a heightened sense of self-awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
              All my journal entries will act as a time capsule of the experiences I have had. Anything that I felt that was worth telling is written in my journal. So, when I am older, I will get a huge wave of nostalgia when looking back at this and with any major struggle that I have, once I escape that struggle, I will be able to look back on the things I went through with pride knowing that I overcame them. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Self-Improvement: </b>Journaling creates self-improvement because it allows me to better solve my problems because I talk about them as if I am talking to a therapist. It also allows me to view my past beliefs and see if they were beneficial to my growth or not. For example, I used to journal mostly when negative things occurred in my life. That resulted in a large chunk of journal entries being about negativity. Looking back on those entries, I was able to realize how much focus I put on my struggles and how little focus I put on gratitude, and that allowed me to correct that and become happier with what I currently have.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Waking Up Early (5:30am): </b>During first year university, I watched a lot of self-improvement videos and saw that many high achieving individuals wake up very early in the mourning. So, that inspired me to do the same.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Validation: </b>There is prestige in waking up early, because you are awake before anyone else and immediately working on yourself.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Self-Improvement: </b>Waking up early allows me to accomplish things earlier, it forces a good sleep schedule, encourages discipline, and starts the day off well.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples of failures that do not apply the framework</h3>
        <p>
          In order for a goal I create to succeed, it must seek for both validation and self-improvement. These are examples of goals I have created that were one missing one piece of the puzzle.
        </p>
        <b>Things that I've done only for validation:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Running: </b>The gyms closed during covid-19 lockdowns so I tried running as a replacement. I ended up giving up on this because I used running as a temporary replacement, so there was no goal for it. So, it ended up feeling pointless.        
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Things I'm trying to do, but are only for self-improvement (I can't find a good way to make it validating):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Meditation: </b>When I started, I had some validation from the prestige in meditation. However, that caused me to not focus on the meditation and more on getting it done. When I focus more on the meditation, it ultimately failed because I felt no sense of validation strong enough to keep me doing it. Sitting in silence and doing nothing makes 10 minutes feel like 30 minutes and that takes a lot of effort for minimal short-term reward.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Reading: </b>I'm a really slow reader. I would normally get validation from completing normal sized chapters, but I read so slow that I lose interest before I can finish the chapter. So, I have to stop before chapter.  
            </p> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Flexibility Exercises: </b>I want to become flexible enough to be able to do the splits. However, the stretching exercises necessary to get there are to painful that there is no short-term gratification that comes with stretching.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Future plans for this framework</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Music Creation: </b> I want to become proficient at the guitar and or the piano. I mostly want to do this for the prestige in being able to create enjoyable melodies. However, because there are a lot of benefits from music creation that elicit self-improvement, it becomes justifiable. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The plan is to create validation by recording my progress every single time a practice learning an instrument and upload that video to YouTube as unlisted. This will create a log of my progress and cause me to want to work on it as often as possible to create a large library of videos showing my progress from beginner to advanced in music creation.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Possible issues</h3>
        <p>
          With every system, the reasons certain things benefit you within a system can also be the reason they hurt you. I am using the system of societal expectations to achieve the goals I want. The self-improvement goals are created from what society deems valuable. Over achieving on societal expectations is prestigious and that is what creates validation.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way this system hurts me is when I do not get the things that I am expected to accomplish/have in the timeframe I am expected to achieve them, if at all. Society expects you to complete schooling, get a good paying job, get into a good relationship, get married, have a healthy social life, etc. I also accept these expectations on myself. So, if there comes a scenario where I feel society expects me to have reached certain milestones that I believe are worth of having been accomplished (for example, getting married in the window of your mid 20s to your late 30s) and I have not done so, I will feel bad about myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also possible that once I achieve the long-term goals I want to achieve, I may not want to continue working on them (I could be wrong since I have not got to that point with any of my goals). For example, as previously stated, I have a physique that the average person would dream of having. However, there is still a lot of room for me to get stronger and build more muscle. Building muscle and strength will eventually lead to a plateau where it becomes impossible to get bigger and stronger without performance enhancing drugs. So, once I get to that point, there will no longer be a long-term goal. It will just be me maintaining my gains, and that may result in me not caring enough about my workouts because it will feel pointless, which may result in me losing strength and muscle.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          This framework uses our primal desires for validation instead of fighting against them to achieve our goals. It can also sometimes act like a back door to achieving your goals. If you want to achieve a goal but do not want to do the work directly, you can do something else that indirectly reaches that goal as a by product.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was using long before I was aware that it existed. It can be used by many other people. But I'm not sure if it can apply to everyone. If you decide to try accomplishing goals with this framework and you fail, it is possible that you are either applying the framework incorrectly or it is simply not meant for you. If it's not meant for you then it is important that figure out the frameworks that you create in your own life so that you can use it in the best way possible and minimize any possible downsides to it while also maximizing the benefits.
